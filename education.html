									<h2>So what is death literacy?</h2>

										an indiduals wishes for what to happen when they pass.<br>
										It includes important support regarding end-of-life matters such as:

											<li>Assigning power of attorney for their estate</li>
											<li>Certifying their end-of-life wishes in a will</li>
											<li>Adhering to any religeous or cultural needs a person has</li>
											<li>Emotional and psychological awareness of mortality</li>

									<h2>What is the history of death literacy?</h2>
									<p>Death literacy has been practiced for thousands of years, with each culture having
										their own form of understanding of mortality.<br>
										Many ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Egyptians had rituals surrounding a person's
										passing, where their life was celebrated.
										There were fewer medical interventions regarding death in those days, most people passed at home,
										surrounded by family, making the process a very bittersweet, emotional experience.<br>
										When religeon became more prominant across the world, death literacy was still practiced,
										but in a different way. People were comforted when their time was coming, but 
										there was a much bigger emphasis on having lived a life that aligned with their
										religeous values, and therefore the person being accepted into whatever awaited them according to their religeon's teachings.
